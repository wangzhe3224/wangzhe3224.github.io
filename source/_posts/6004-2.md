# The Digital Abstraction

Q: the physical representation of bits?

Then ask what is a good bit?
- small
- cheap
- stable
- easy and fast to manipulate, access/transform/combine/store/transmit

Industry selected to use voltage to represent information. 
But the system need to tolerate errors.

Encode 1 bit with 0 or 1. 

Digitalize voltage with buffer.

## Combinational logic

Stateless machine

## Sequential logic

Circuits that include both combinational logic and memory components are called sequential logic.

## Finite state machine

# Instruction Set Architectures

An instruction is the fundamental unit of work, it includes: opcode to be performed and operands, destination for the result.

ISA, is a contract between software and hardware. ISA is the first abstraction layer that describes what CPU can do but hides how CPU do it.

## Beta: a RISC, reduced instruction set computer.

## Assembly

A human readable ISA+ 

## Compiler

High level languages. Two basic execution logic: interpretation and complilation. 

Front end + Back end.

## Procedures, abstraction by high level languages

# Memory tech
